## Current Status

In production -- working on known bugs. Basic MVP achieved

## Concept

A Journaling App to help those who suffer from mental health issues because journaling has been proven to be helpful in treating some mental health obstacles

1. you take a quiz that assesses if you're leaning toward depression, anger, or anxiety
2. It pairs you with a music artist based on that answer
3. When you go to add a new entry you take another short quiz that asks how you're feeling that day and how we can help you with what you're feeling
4. Based on that answer, it populates a curated Spotify playlist (with songs from the artist you were paired with) for you to listen to while journaling
5. At the top of the journal page it has a quote from one of the songs from the curated playlist to use as a prompt (since "not know what to write about" is a top reason people discontinue journaling)
6. When you finish your entry you can choose to share it anonymously or not at all
7. You can then go to a page to see all the entries that were shared by other users of the app
